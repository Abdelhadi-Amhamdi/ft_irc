TOPIC :(Change the channel topic)
-------

TOPIC #channel :New topic text goes here // set a topic
TOPIC #channel : // clear the topic
TOPIC #channel // show topic

If a channel does not have the +t mode set, it means that any user,
 including those without operator status can change topic .
 else
if (!operator) //operator means(@user) == "+o" as a mode
	you are not a channel operator.


A message is typically broadcast to all users in the channel:
[User] sets topic: New topic text goes here

Clients joining the channel in the future will receive a RPL_TOPIC numeric (or lack thereof) accordingly.

____________________________________________________________

INVITE : (to invite a user to join a specific channel)
--------

!!!!!if the channel exists, only members of the channel
are allowed to invite other users.  When the channel has invite-only
flag set, only channel operators may issue INVITE command.

The user who receives the invitation can choose whether to accept or decline it.

the invited user typically receives a notice or message indicating the invitation

!!!!! Servers SHOULD NOT send multiple channels in this message to clients,
and SHOULD distribute these multiple-channel PART messages
as a series of messages with a single channel name on each.

all clients in the channel also receive a
PART message(include the one who has part the channel)
Once all users in a channel have left that channel, the channel must be destroyed.

****t****(Set/remove the restrictions of the TOPIC command to channel operators)
****k****(Set/remove the channel key (password))

Channel lifetime

   In regard to the lifetime of a channel, there are typically two
   groups of channels: standard channels which prefix is either '&', '#'
   or '+', and "safe channels" which prefix is '!'.


Since channels starting with the character '+' as prefix do not
   support channel modes, no member can therefore have the status of
   channel operator.
