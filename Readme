Channel lifetime

   In regard to the lifetime of a channel, there are typically two
   groups of channels: standard channels which prefix is either '&', '#'
   or '+', and "safe channels" which prefix is '!'.


(momkin channel maykonch 3ndha ta chi operator)

Since channels starting with the character '+' as prefix do not
   support channel modes, no member can therefore have the status of
   channel operator.
